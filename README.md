# Python Programming Essentials for Data Science
&emsp; &emsp; Create a simple program that allows the user to simulate a mini grocery checkout experience. The user will input the names and prices of 3 items, and the system will calculate the total, apply a discount if eligible, and print a receipt. <br>

### âœ… Requirements:
1. Prompt the user to enter:
    - Name and price of 3 items
2. Compute the total price
3. If the total exceeds â‚±500, apply a 10% discount
4. Display a receipt that includes:
    - Item names and prices
    - Total before discount
    - Discount amount (if any)
    - Final amount to pay
5. Use functions for:
    - Calculating total
    - Applying discount
    - Displaying the receipt

### ðŸ§© Bonus Challenge:
- Allow the user to input how many items they want to buy (not just 3)
- Use a for loop to collect inputs dynamically
